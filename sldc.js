// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In the analysis of requirements step, it's analysed how best to proceed and how feasible is the software given the allotted budget"
const design = "A blueprint of the software is made, which also helps to determine hardware requirements"
const implementation = "In this step, developers begin actually writing the code for the software"
const testingAndIntegration = "Functionality of the software is tested to determine if it is working as intended and/or if there are any bugs.  Once tested and confirmed to be in working form, the software is then deployed to the customer's system for use"
const maintain = "In this step, the customer has begun using the product and if there are any issues, the developer would test and fix these issues as they arise."
